# 💧 Water Quality Portal Data Dashboard

The **Water Quality Portal (WQP) Data Dashboard** is a visual analytics project that consolidates and interprets water quality records from U.S. government sources, focusing on environmental monitoring in Kansas. Built using **Power BI**, the dashboard integrates multiple datasets to provide rich, interactive insights for public health, policy, and ecological research.

## 🌐 Project Overview

This project transforms raw data into meaningful dashboards using **Power BI**, enabling stakeholders to explore spatial, temporal, and demographic trends in water quality. It leverages data from USGS, EPA, and additional demographic sources to deliver insights that support better water resource management.

## 📊 Dashboards (Built in Power BI)

### 📍 1. Kansas County Demographics & Environmental Monitoring Dashboard

- Displays population distribution by county.
- Maps 1,000+ water quality monitoring stations (rivers, wells, lakes).
- Shows drainage areas and highlights focus on surface water.
